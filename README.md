This project is to create an agent that plays the game of Mastermind. 
This is an assignment for my Artificial Intelligence class. 
The engine is given by our lecturer Lech Szymanski. 
What I did is to build my_agent.py that plays the game.
I use min-average strategy for choosing the next guess, and I believe it is as good as the max-entropy method.

For a further detail of the algorithm, please see my_report.pdf.
